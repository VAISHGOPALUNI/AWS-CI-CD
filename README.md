# AWS-CI-CD
Just kickstarted a simple Java web app hosted on AWS ðŸš€

Hereâ€™s what I did:
âœ… Launched an EC2 instance.
âœ… Used VSCode to set up a remote SSH connection to my EC2 instance.
âœ… Used Apache Maven and Java to generate a basic web app structure.

ðŸŒŸ The highlight for me was integrating VSCode and EC2 to set up an IDE for a virtual machine!
